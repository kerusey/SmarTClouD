Hey there! Here is my project called SmarTClouD. 

Project includes:
  Schemes of magneto-levitating system
  Source code
  

This repository combines two different projects: the megneto levitating system and the colormusic for the cloud. 
I’ve tride to make such cloud as Richard Clarkson’s studio produces.

The main idea of the project was the levitating cloud above some sort of platform.
I used the crealev company magnet levitation system patent to create the base of project (platform), but whith my own coil-control system.

Technical shift: probably you'll need 
1 more variable height that will contains the height of levitation moduel
also you may need a func find_height (); 
maybe change const_alpha 
change default_resistance
also rewrite coil buck and boost for AD8400 for 1 kOhm (Now it is written for X9C)
