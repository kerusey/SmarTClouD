Hey there! Here is my project called SmarTClouD. 

Project includes:
  - Schemes of magneto-levitating system
  - Source code of levitron
  - And README file, that i hope will help you to understand what's going on
  
  
This repository combines two different projects: the megneto levitating system and the colormusic for the cloud. 
I’ve tride to make such cloud as Richard Clarkson’s studio produces.

The main idea of the project was the levitating cloud above some sort of platform.
I used the crealev company magnet levitation system patent to create the base of project (platform), but whith my own coil-control system.
